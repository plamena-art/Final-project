RA1. Create a software development requirement and planning document for your app.(include this file in one zip file with your source code files)
RA2. Create a statement of purpose for your APP, including:
	-What the application will do;
	-What buisness problem it addresses;
	-The target audience;
RA3. Develop a list of features that will be included in the APP.
RA4. Develop an implementation plan which details the steps and tasks required to implement your APP.
RA5. Code(implement) all the features of your APP using a variety of Java programing constructs, but not limited:
	-Variables;
	-Conditional/control flow statements ( if/else, switch, etc)
	-Loops;
	-Class;
	-Methods;
	-Input/output;
	-Error handling;
RA6. Create an APP which runs without error and has the features consistent with the planning document.
RA7. Use source control(GIT) throughout the development of the APP.
	-Make regular commints ( a minimum of 15 ) Ensure a meaningful commit message that summarises the changes;(submit all code, source, dependencies files in one zip file)
	-Optionally push the commits to a remote repository; ( submit a source control repository as a zip file)
RA8. Use industry standart style and naming conventions for your JAVA code.
RA9. Apply the DRY ( do not repeat yourself ) to all your code.
RA10. Design, document and run a simple test on your APP.
RA11. Present your APP to the audience.

Optional: To help with your design and implementation you are strongly encouraged to create a diagram(s) which illustrates the workflow/control flow/logic of your APP. Include in your README file with an appropriate heading.
